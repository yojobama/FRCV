|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Get video sources | `/api/videoFileSource/getAll` | GET | Retrieve all video file sources |
| Create video sources | `/api/videoFileSource/create` | POST | Upload multiple video files |

| Create all cameras | `/api/cameraSource/createAll` | POST | Create sources for all cameras |

## File Upload Flow

1. **File Selection**: User selects files via modal or drag-and-drop
2. **Client Validation**: Files validated for type, size, and count
3. **Upload Preparation**: Valid files categorized by type
4. **Server Upload**: Files sent to appropriate endpoints
5. **Progress Tracking**: Visual feedback during upload
6. **Result Display**: Success/failure feedback with details
7. **Data Refresh**: Source list updated with new entries

## Error Handling

### Client-Side Validation
- File type verification
- File size limits
- File count restrictions
- Real-time feedback

### Server-Side Error Handling
- Network error detection
- HTTP status code handling
- Detailed error messaging
- Graceful failure recovery

## Performance Optimizations

- **Chunked uploads**: Large files handled efficiently
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time upload status
- **Parallel processing**: Videos and images uploaded simultaneously
- **Local validation**: Reduces server load
- **Auto-retry**: Failed uploads can be retried

## Future Enhancements

When additional features are implemented:

1. **Upload resumption** for interrupted transfers
2. **Thumbnail generation** for uploaded videos/images
3. **Metadata extraction** (resolution, duration, etc.)
4. **Batch processing** with custom settings per file
5. **Cloud storage integration** for large files
6. **Advanced file format support** (RAW images, additional codecs)

## Testing Notes
